You just canâ€™t stop thinking about it and want to share it with others, and maybe even find more sandwiches in hopes of replicating that experience.
PROJECT SANDWICH is a site for avid sandwich aficionados to come together and rave about all the cathartic Cheesesteaks, transformative Tunamelts and profound PB&Js of the world. Join us in Club Sandwich and find your next best sandwich experience today!
